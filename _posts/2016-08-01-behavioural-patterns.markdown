Access is allowed if a users activity matches past behaviour. For example, a card transaction might be declined if used somewhere the user doesn't usually go to.

### Examples
* Online bank transfer declined sent to an account they've not sent to before
* Facebook blocks login if using an IP the user doesn't usually visit from
* LastPass declines access to the service when a user is abroad. The user can confirm that they are elsewhere by confirming via link sent by email
