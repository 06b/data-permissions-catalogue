title: About the Data Permissions Catalogue
---

The internet is full of patterns. When someone solves a problem in a way that's easy for others to copy, it quickly spreads. That's why the way we do things like shop or search for things often look similar, even when the services we use are different.

### Patterns can help build better services

The Data Permissions Catalogue is a tool for people who build digital services. It collects different patterns for getting consent from users, asking for access to personal data and for sharing data with third parties.

At [IF](https://projectsbyif.com/), we think many of the most common patterns for sharing personal data are broken. That's why we built this catalogue. 

We think there are more empowering ways for people to share information with services. Patterns that repect people's rights and give people the opportunity to hold services to account if something goes wrong.

We hope it will help teams all over the world think about consent and trust in a new way.
