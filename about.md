title: About the Data Permissions Catalogue
---

The Data Permissions Catalogue is a tool for people who build digital services to think about consent and trust in a new way.

It collects different patterns for getting consent from users, asking for access to personal data and for sharing data with third parties.

The catalogue is an [open-source project](#) built and maintained by [IF](/contribute)

### Patterns can help build better services

We think there are more empowering ways for people to share information with services. Patterns that repect people's rights and give people the opportunity to hold services to account if something goes wrong.
