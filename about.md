title: About the Data Permissions Catalogue
---

Weâ€™ve compiled this catalogue as a tool for teams building digital services.

It collects different patterns for a range of data sharing activities, from getting consent from users to asking for access to personal data and sharing data with third parties.

Our aim is to:

- Introduce people to subject of data sharing
- Give people a shared language to talk about data sharing
- Help teams make better products and services by influencing product teams
- Ensure we can all make better decisions about how to empower people and give them more rights

[Contribute by documenting missing patterns](/contribute).

The catalogue is built and maintained by [IF](https://projectsbyif.com/).
