title: Multi-factor using a generator

category: Authenticate

advantages:
  - code is only valid short period of time
  - alternative to [passwords](/patterns/secret-answer) that can be guessed or stolen.
  - by requiring extra information sent to a device controlled by a particular person, it increases the confidence that the request to access data should be allowed.

limitations:
  - access to app or device can be lost
  - requires someone to have the device on them

This type of [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) involves a person entering a code generated by an app or a device when requesting access to data.

The code is specific to that person and device the code is generated on, is single use and expires after a short amount of time. If the person enters a valid code, it is assumed that they have physical ownership over the nominated device that codes can be generated on.
