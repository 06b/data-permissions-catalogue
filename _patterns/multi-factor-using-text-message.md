This type of [multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) involves a person entering a code sent in a text message to a nominated phone when requesting access to data.

The code is specific to that person, is single use and expires after a short amount of time. If the person enters a valid code, it is assumed that they have physical ownership over a mobile phone.
