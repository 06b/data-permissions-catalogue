The Data Permissions Catalogue is a open source project, maintained by [IF](https://projectsbyif.com) since 2016.

Contributions to the catalogue are encouraged. Every suggested new pattern or bit of feedback helps keep this a useful and current resource for everyone to use.

There are two ways to contribute new patterns or feedback:

[ ‘form’ bottom ] or  [ ‘GitHub’ bottom ]

Every contribution is reviewed before it’s potentially committed to the catalogue. People are credited on the pages they’ve contributed.
